                    I'm Adonay, currently I live in SÃ£o Paulo working as a 
                    Full-Stack freelancer. My projects include WebDevelopment 
                    with CRUD in memory using MongoDB or MySQL. I'm looking for 
                    a job, if you see my portfolio and you're interested, send
                    me a message.

                    <p className="p-about">
                    In my spare time i like to practice English, play video 
                    games, to read, and solve logical problems with code. 
                    I'm always down for hearing about new projects, problems or 
                    some stuff like that, thanks for your attention!
